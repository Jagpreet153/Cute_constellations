# Cute_constellations



We've created a website that allows users to learn about the constellations .

By simply entering the name of a constellation, users can access information about the details,timing, best view conditions and other key characteristics. 

Building this website was a challenge, but we learned so much along the way. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript we had the opportunity to hone my skills as a web developer and explore new technologies.
